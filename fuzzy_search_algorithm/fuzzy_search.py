"""
Fuzzy search refers to searching for similar strings in the records instead of the exact same one. This is useful in many scenarios as typo is extremely common thing.

There are various ways to implement fuzzy serch. Among them, Levenstein's distance is one way to approximate the search term.

Levenstein's distance:
    - It provides the minimum changes required between two terms to achieve each other. (i.e. number of insertions, deletions and edits)

Thus, it'd be interesting to see this in action.
